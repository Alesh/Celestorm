=========

This package simplifies the development of distributed applications for modern
modular blockchain networks. It includes ready-to-use protocol templates and
generic base classes with partial implementations, enabling the creation of
an execution layer that integrates as a module into a blockchain platform stack.

The package serves as a bridge between the underlying blockchain network and the
application logic of your project.
