Celestorm
=========

Celestorm is a Python package that enables the design of a part of a distributed
application as an execution layer for modular blockchains. This functionality,
combined with the use of modern blockchains (such as Avail, Celestia, Near DA, 
etc.) that support a data availability layer (DA-layer), simplifies the creation 
of distributed solutions for specific tasks. The package's modules abstract away
blockchain interaction and state management, providing flexibility and platform
independence.
